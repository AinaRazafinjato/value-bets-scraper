## üß™ Simulation vs Real Mode

- If the scraping module is not available, the application will run in simulation mode
- Simulation mode generates synthetic data to test the interface
- For real scraping, ensure Playwright and BeautifulSoup libraries are properly installed

## üîß Configuration

Modify variables in `.env` to enter your configuration details.
Add your OddsPortal username and password, as well as other scraping parameters.

```env
# Authentication settings
ODDPORTAL_USERNAME=your_username
ODDPORTAL_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## üìä Visualization Examples

The application generates two main types of visualizations:

- **Value distribution**: histogram showing the distribution of value percentages
- **Bookmaker breakdown**: bar chart showing bets by bookmaker

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Scraping may be detected by some sites and temporarily blocked
- Statistics are based solely on data available in the CSV file
- Scraping speed depends on internet connection and target site responsiveness
